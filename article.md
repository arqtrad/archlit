Introduction
============

The critique of architectural character in Portugal and Brazil from the
mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries derives much of its
motivation and methodology from literary history and criticism.
Moreover, it plays out to a great extent within literary circles, even
as a Portuguese-language architectural press emerges during the Belle
Époque. This context has made the rise of architectural theory in these
two nations virtually invisible to a historiography still mostly
concerned with the study of strictly disciplinary texts[^1].

* * * *

The resulting traditionalist discourses have been based on a stark
differentiation between popular and high culture, privileging rural
housing types after the example of ethnographers, who sought the roots
of national literature in the folk poetry in remote communities. The
virtual unity of the Portuguese language prompts architectural
theorists well into the twentieth century to seek likewise a single
stem-type from which to extract either the forms or the spirit of a new
tradition.

Whereas the notion of a unitary architectural stem has been long
discredited, it leaves behind an imaginary landscape of regional
traditions. A cartography of this landscape can not only locate the
source material leveraged from a variety of vernacular types and
hybrids, but also trace them to the resulting reconstructions, from
explicitly “traditionalist” designs to modernist variations on the
vernacular "spirit."
By envisioning this virtual cartography, I seek to show how architects
and architectural critics in Portugal and Brazil appropriate the goals
and perspectives of literary historians even before the rise of
traditionalist architectural styles. I argue the conflation of diverse
regional traditions into unitary images of national architecture is
evidence not of the "failure" of a retrospectively construed concept of
authenticity, but a way to make sense of a new apparatus of
architectural criticism.

Architectural Theory as Literary Genre
======================================

The scope and role of literary discourses on architecture during the
nineteenth century are scarcely acknowledged in the scholarship of
Portuguese and Brazilian architecture. The literary milieu is quite
distinct from that of the engineering and infrastructure debates arising
around the same time, and far less popular among, or methodologically
accessible to, architectural historians. The disciplinary corps of
architecture, ever on the lookout for "pioneers" of modernity, has
focused overwhelmingly on the technical and political aspects of urban
reform [@lisboa:2002engenheiros; @salgueiro:2001cidades] or, at best, on
the built outcomes of socioeconomic change [@lemos:1999republica;
@depaoli:2013entre]. Even as a growing body of social and literary
historians have sought to interpret writers' experiences of the urban
environment [@acerbi:2014long; @aragao:2012passeio;
@colonetti:2007selecao3; @pedruzzi:2008rio3; @resende:2016lima;
@schwarcz:2017minha31; @staudt:2009rio], the influence of literary
history, as well as of the methods of ethnographic critique that stem
from it in the late nineteenth century, in shaping a theory of
architecture is still mostly overlooked.

It is true that, in contrast to the world of civil and social
engineering, architectural theory remains, well into the nineteenth
century, something for the "learned enjoyment" of well-to-do men (seldom
women) of letters. Such is the target audience for João Pacheco's 1734
compendium of cultural and scientific trivia
[@pacheco:1734divertimento], a staple of aristocratic libraries for a
long time thereafter [@macedo:2017biblioteca]. As late as 1823, the
Portuguese court architect, Cyrillo Volkmar Machado (1748--1823)
recommends the study of his Vasarian biographies of artists to "polite"
and "learned" men, that is, to the well-born dilettante
[@machado:1922colleccao, 1]. Conversely, many professional architects
shy away from these elevated circles, or else establish a fitting ethos
in their writing by styling themselves poets, journalists, or
scientists, rather than men of the trade. Such is the case of the
Portuguese architect, archaeologist, and academician, Joaquim Possidónio
Narciso da Silva (1806--1896), as well as of the Brazilian artist, poet,
and diplomat, Manuel de Araújo Porto-Alegre (1806--1879), both of whom
were well versed in science and literature, and had inroads to their
respective royal and imperial courts.

Architectural culture will nevertheless thrive within literary---and, by
extension, historical---circles throughout the nineteenth century, and
muster from it a methodological apparatus as well as a set of historical
references pertaining to the questions of national character and
tradition. A young Araújo Porto-Alegre addresses these questions in what
is among the earliest studies on Brazilian art, a report read before the
Institut Historique in Paris in 1834. His account of colonial
architecture (seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) concocts for it a
commendable Renaissance genealogy that "evidences .\.. the taste of the
new Roman school of Bramante and Buonarroti" and displays even, in one
church, "as if a distant reflection of the admirable frescos of the
Vatican [@magalhaes:1834resume, 50]." Not content with relating
Brazilian architecture directly to Italian sources, Araújo Porto-Alegre
goes so far as to frame its achievements as an unlikely triumph over the
hindrance of Portuguese philistinism [@magalhaes:1834resume, 50]. This
claim sets in motion a nationalist debate on the relationship between
Portuguese tradition and Brazilian particularity that will last for
upwards of a century.

The prescriptive definition of national character in art requires, of
course, a documented body of knowledge on what national art is to begin
with. At this point, the two strands of Romanticism tug in opposite
directions: on one side is the drive for personal originality,
represented by Araújo Porto-Alegre; on the other, nationalist
revivalism, represented by the Portuguese writers, João Baptista da
Silva Leitão de Almeida Garrett (1799--1854) and Alexandre Herculano
(1810--1877). The Brazilian master shifts the burden
of building a Brazilian artistic "School" towards the future and onto
the Beaux-Arts education provided by the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts
(AIBA). As its director from 1854 to 1857, he commands a comprehensive
program reform that puts at its center the Romanticist principle of
fostering creative originality rather than academic conformity
[@lima:2016digne, n. 3]. Araújo Porto-Alegre's effort will reach its
culmination under the late-nineteenth-century generation of artists and
theoreticians, at the forefront of which stands the novelist and art
critic, Luís Gonzaga Duque Estrada (1863--1911). Due to this focus on
creative originality as a precondition for an authentic national style,
Gonzaga Duque will be chiefly interested in the social and cultural
conditions surrounding the production of art and architecture, rather
than in architectural forms strictly speaking [@guimaraes:2001empenho,
23]. Therefore, his anticlerical opinions lead him, in his early history
of Brazilian art, to dismiss the mannerist style of early Jesuitic
architecture as "evidently lacking in taste" [@gonzagaduque:1995arte].
That one of the few opinions on architecture to come out of Araújo
Porto-Alegre's "spiritual lineage" should be such a curt judgment on the
subject is evidence of the low value ascribed to primary documentation
in this critical circle.

The Portuguese Romanticist writers, on the other hand, place increasing
emphasis on the documentation of sources not only for historical
writing, Herculano's lifelong effort, but even for literary creation.
Almeida Garrett dedicates much of his early work, compiled in the 1843
*Romanceiro geral,* to reinterpretations of popular poetry
[@monteiro:2019refiguracoes]. His 1844 poem *Miragaia,* described in the
foreword as "a true reconstruction of an ancient monument"
[@almeidagarrett:1844miragaia], is illustrated with compelling etchings
of Gothic and Islamic architecture by Manuel Bordallo Pinheiro
(1815--1880), evidencing their interest in a comprehensive historical
ambiance that ranges from the purported authenticity of the text to its
pictorial decoration. Another scion of this Romanticist circle, the
Brazilian-born poet, Antonio Gonçalves Dias (1823--1864) takes this
interest one step further. After completing his studies in Portugal,
Gonçalves Dias returns to Brazil thoroughly imbued with the nationalist
emphasis on documentation promoted by Almeida Garrett and Herculano. In
1859, Gonçalves Dias is entrusted with the "ethnography and narrative
section" of the Scientific Commission of Exploration, an expedition to
the Northeast Brazilian province of Ceará that seeks to document various
social and natural features of that region. This Commission, established
under the aegis of the Brazilian Historical and Geographic Institute
(IHGB), will ultimately expose the conflicts inherent to the framing of
national identity as something to be both *documented* and *created* in
a single literary or artistic process.

The crux of the conflict that arises together with ethnographic
documentation in Portugal and Brazil has to do with the authority
attributed to sources and methods. The process by which writers have
traditionally acknowledged authority, based on cross-examination of the
classics, is challenged by the rising prestige of popular literature,
championed by Almeida Garrett, as well as by increasing competition
between historians of literature and natural scientists for the
legitimacy to describe social and ethnic groups. In this context, it is
perhaps not surprising Gonçalves Dias should eventually fall out with
the Expedition's leader, physician and zoologist Manuel Ferreira Lagos
(1816--1870), who seems to consider the ethnographic section as being
of lesser importance than zoology, botany, and mineralogy
[@kury:2001comissao, 39]. Gonçalves Dias's insistence on fulfilling the
Commission's original goal of studying all of Brazil's northerly
provinces, even as when the other sections' work is called off after
documenting a single province, further exposes these conflicts. He
collects products from communities descended both from native groups and
from Portuguese colonists, "far beyond the confines of ...
civilization," as one major Rio newspaper reports [@exposicao:1861-246,
1], and scours the Amazon region looking for non acculturated native
communities. This is at odds, however, with what is seen by his
contemporaries as the Commission's "great merit, which is to evidence
the existence of the necessary elements for the creation of industry,"
implying a focus on craft traditions that are already somewhat close to
modern Brazilian society [@exposicao:1861-246, 1].

Meanwhile, Portugal is emerging from a traumatic political and economic
restructuring after the civil war of 1828--1832, and her intellectuals
are contemplating their country's uninspiring prospects as a waning
colonial power. On both shores of the Atlantic, political and
infrastructural modernization becomes a concern far more pressing than
the affirmation of national identity. Nevertheless, modernization
itself, along with the political crisis of the late nineteenth century,
is to become a catalyst for a renewed interest in national
identity---this time around, in the form of longing for the lost roots
of cultural identity.

Crisis of Cultural Nation-building
==================================

Up until the 1860s, therefore, the actual form of the built environment
has been of little consequence to the literary debates around national
character. As the unstable political and cultural climate of the liberal
monarchies in both Portugal and Brazil wears on through the second half
of the nineteenth century, however, the tension rises between the
endeavors of, on the one hand, *documenting* national culture as
traditionally attested in popular art and, on the other hand, *creating*
works of high art that are able to express this national culture while
following modern taste and productive conditions. In both
Portugal and Brazil, already in the 1860s, literary and artistic elites
grow insecure about the path of nation-building through which the
Romanticist generation confidently forged ahead. The forward-looking
"history" of Portuguese-language literature, prevalent from the 1830s to
50s, thus gives way to a comprehensive search *backwards* for the roots
of Portuguese ethnicity as well as for markers of originality in
Brazilian culture. Architects will play a cautious
role in this process, at some times even stepping back altogether from
the issue of national character, at other times expressing a derivative,
aesthetic aspect of debates played out away from their disciplinary
field.

It is up to another of Brazil's major novelists, Joaquim
Manuel de Macedo (1820--1882), to nudge the literary discussion of
architecture 

The reasons Lagos has for picking Ceará as the first and, due to lack of
funding, only published subject of the IHGB expedition are not clear,
but it is probably no coincidence. Ceará is located in the historic
crucible of Portuguese expansion, claiming some of the early hinterland
cities of the colonial period. It is also a major center of high culture
in the mid nineteenth century, with such illustrious contemporaries of
the expedition as writer José de Alencar (1829--1877), in addition to
several IHGB members at the time.

products collected by the ethnography section eventually make it to the
Brazilian gallery at the
1862 International Exhibition in London.

Traditionalist Methods and Ethnographic Tools
=============================================

Oftentimes, rather than emulating the basic methods of data collection
performed by ethnographers and literary historians, architectural
theories will build upon the higher-order interpretations and even upon
the general conclusions laid out in that scholarship.
