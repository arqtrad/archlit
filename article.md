Introduction
============

The critique of architectural character in Portugal and Brazil from the
mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries derives much of its
motivation and methodology from literary history and criticism.
Moreover, it plays out to a great extent within literary circles, even
as a Portuguese-language architectural press emerges during the Belle
Époque. This context has made the rise of architectural theory in these
two nations virtually invisible to a historiography still mostly
concerned with the study of strictly disciplinary texts[^1].

* * * *

The resulting traditionalist discourses have been based on a stark
differentiation between popular and high culture, privileging rural
housing types after the example of ethnographers, who sought the roots
of national literature in the folk poetry in remote communities. The
virtual unity of the Portuguese language prompts architectural
theorists well into the twentieth century to seek likewise a single
stem-type from which to extract either the forms or the spirit of a new
tradition.

Whereas the notion of a unitary architectural stem has been long
discredited, it leaves behind an imaginary landscape of regional
traditions. A cartography of this landscape can not only locate the
source material leveraged from a variety of vernacular types and
hybrids, but also trace them to the resulting reconstructions, from
explicitly “traditionalist” designs to modernist variations on the
vernacular "spirit."
By envisioning this virtual cartography, I seek to show how architects
and architectural critics in Portugal and Brazil appropriate the goals
and perspectives of literary historians even before the rise of
traditionalist architectural styles. I argue the conflation of diverse
regional traditions into unitary images of national architecture is
evidence not of the "failure" of a retrospectively construed concept of
authenticity, but a way to make sense of a new apparatus of
architectural criticism.

Architectural Theory as Literary Genre
======================================

The scope and role of literary discourses on architecture during the
nineteenth century are scarcely acknowledged in the scholarship of
Portuguese and Brazilian architecture. The literary milieu is quite
distinct from that of the engineering and infrastructure debates arising
around the same time, and far less popular among, or methodologically
accessible to, architectural historians. The disciplinary corps of
architecture, ever on the lookout for "pioneers" of modernity, has
focused overwhelmingly on the technical and political aspects of urban
reform [@lisboa:2002engenheiros; @salgueiro:2001cidades] or, at best, on
the built outcomes of socioeconomic change [@lemos:1999republica;
@depaoli:2013entre]. Even as a growing body of social and literary
historians have sought to interpret writers' experiences of the urban
environment [@acerbi:2014long; @aragao:2012passeio;
@colonetti:2007selecao3; @pedruzzi:2008rio3; @resende:2016lima;
@schwarcz:2017minha31; @staudt:2009rio], the influence of literary
history, as well as of the methods of ethnographic critique that stem
from it in the late nineteenth century, in shaping a theory of
architecture is still mostly overlooked.

It is true that, in contrast to the world of civil and social
engineering, architectural theory remains, well into the nineteenth
century, something for the "learned enjoyment" of well-to-do men (seldom
women) of letters. Such is the target audience for João Pacheco's 1734
compendium of cultural and scientific trivia
[@pacheco:1734divertimento], a staple of aristocratic libraries for a
long time thereafter [@macedo:2017biblioteca]. As late as 1823, a
posthumous work by the Portuguese court architect, Cyrillo Volkmar
Machado (1748--1823) recommends the study of his Vasarian biographies of
artists to "polite" and "learned" men, that is, to the well-born
dilettante [@machado:1922colleccao, 1]. Conversely, many professional
architects shy away from these elevated circles, or else establish a
fitting ethos in their writing by styling themselves poets, journalists,
or scientists, rather than men of the trade. Such is the case of the
Portuguese architect, archaeologist, and academician, Joaquim Possidónio
Narciso da Silva (1806--1896), as well as of the Brazilian artist, poet,
and diplomat, Manuel de Araújo Porto-Alegre (1806--1879), both of whom
were well versed in science and literature, and had inroads to their
respective royal and imperial courts.

Architectural culture will nevertheless thrive within literary---and, by
extension, historical---circles throughout the nineteenth century, and
muster from it a methodological apparatus as well as a set of historical
references pertaining to the questions of national character and
tradition. A young Araújo Porto-Alegre addresses these questions in what
is among the earliest studies on Brazilian art, a report read before the
Institut Historique in Paris in 1834. His account of colonial
architecture (seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) concocts for it a
commendable Renaissance genealogy that "evidences .\.. the taste of the
new Roman school of Bramante and Buonarroti" and displays even, in one
church, "as if a distant reflection of the admirable frescos of the
Vatican [@magalhaes:1834resume, 50]." Not content with relating
Brazilian architecture directly to Italian sources, Araújo Porto-Alegre
goes so far as to frame its achievements as an unlikely triumph over the
hindrance of Portuguese philistinism [@magalhaes:1834resume, 50]. This
claim sets in motion a nationalist debate on the relationship between
Portuguese tradition and Brazilian particularity that will last for
upwards of a century.

The prescriptive definition of national character in art requires, of
course, a documented body of knowledge on what national art is to begin
with. At this point, the two strands of Romanticism tug in opposite
directions: on one side is the drive for personal originality,
represented by Araújo Porto-Alegre; on the other, nationalist
revivalism, represented by the Portuguese writers, João Baptista da
Silva Leitão de Almeida Garrett (1799--1854) and Alexandre Herculano
(1810--1877) [@botelho:2010historiografia, 121]. The Brazilian master
shifts the burden of building a Brazilian artistic "School" towards the
future and onto the Beaux-Arts education provided by the Imperial
Academy of Fine Arts (AIBA). As its director from 1854 to 1857, he
commands a comprehensive program reform that puts at its center the
Romanticist principle of fostering creative originality rather than
academic conformity to a traditional body of knowledge [@lima:2016digne,
n. 3]. In his articles for the journal of the Brazilian Historic and
Geographic Institute (IHGB), Araújo Porto-Alegre therefore follows the
Vasarian biographic scheme also prevalent in Portugal
[@rosmaninho:1993historiografia, 3], describing the artistic
developments in the Brazilian capital as the accumulated contributions
of each individual artist's genius [@araujoportoalegre:1841memoriaIII].
As late as 1855, he carries on the prospective ideal of art history as
spiritual and technical inspiration rather than a documental trove
constituting a source of aesthetic authority:

> My attempt targeted a national thought, namely that of using these
> examples to make other [ideas] of higher value bear fruit in the young
> minds ... [@araujoportoalegre:1855iconographiaXIX, 349]

Araújo Porto-Alegre's effort will reach its
culmination under the late-nineteenth-century generation of artists and
theoreticians, at the forefront of which stands the novelist and art
critic, Luís Gonzaga Duque Estrada (1863--1911). Due to this focus on
creative originality as a precondition for an authentic national style,
Gonzaga Duque will be chiefly interested in the social and cultural
conditions surrounding the production of art and architecture, rather
than in architectural forms strictly speaking [@guimaraes:2001empenho,
23]. Therefore, his anticlerical opinions lead him, in his early history
of Brazilian art, to dismiss the mannerist style of early Jesuitic
architecture as "evidently lacking in taste" [@gonzagaduque:1995arte].
That one of the few opinions on architecture to come out of Araújo
Porto-Alegre's "spiritual lineage" should be such a curt judgment on the
subject is evidence of the low value ascribed to primary documentation
in this critical circle.

The Portuguese Romanticist writers, on the other hand, place increasing
emphasis on the documentation of sources not only for historical
writing, Herculano's lifelong effort, but even for literary creation.
Almeida Garrett dedicates much of his early work, compiled in the 1843
*Romanceiro geral,* to reinterpretations of popular poetry
[@monteiro:2019refiguracoes]. His 1844 poem *Miragaia,* described in the
foreword as "a true reconstruction of an ancient monument"
[@almeidagarrett:1844miragaia], is illustrated with compelling etchings
of Gothic and Islamic architecture by Manuel Bordallo Pinheiro
(1815--1880), evidencing their interest in a comprehensive historical
ambiance that ranges from the purported authenticity of the text to its
pictorial decoration. Another scion of this Romanticist circle, the
Brazilian-born poet, Antonio Gonçalves Dias (1823--1864) takes this
interest one step further. After completing his studies in Portugal,
Gonçalves Dias returns to Brazil thoroughly imbued with the nationalist
emphasis on documentation promoted by Almeida Garrett and Herculano. In
1859, Gonçalves Dias is entrusted with the "ethnography and narrative
section" of the Scientific Commission of Exploration, an expedition to
the Northeast Brazilian province of Ceará that seeks to document various
social and natural features of that region. This Commission, established
under the aegis of the 
IHGB, will ultimately expose the conflicts inherent to the framing of
national identity as something to be both *documented* and *created* in
a single literary or artistic process.

Cultural Nation-building in Crisis
==================================

The crux of the conflict that arises together with ethnographic
documentation in Portugal and Brazil has to do with the authority
attributed to sources and methods. The process by which writers have
traditionally acknowledged authority, based on cross-examination of the
classics, is challenged by the rising prestige of popular literature,
championed by Almeida Garrett, as well as by increasing competition
between historians of literature and natural scientists for the
legitimacy to describe social and ethnic groups. In this context, it is
perhaps not surprising Gonçalves Dias should eventually fall out with
the Expedition's leader, physician and zoologist Manuel Ferreira Lagos
(1816--1870), who seems to consider the ethnographic section as being
of lesser importance than zoology, botany, and mineralogy
[@kury:2001comissao, 39]. Gonçalves Dias's insistence on fulfilling the
Commission's original goal of studying all of Brazil's northerly
provinces, even as when the other sections' work is called off after
documenting a single province, further exposes these conflicts. He
collects products from communities descended both from native groups and
from Portuguese colonists, "far beyond the confines of ...
civilization," as one major Rio newspaper reports [@exposicao:1861-246,
1], and scours the Amazon region looking for non acculturated native
communities. This is at odds, however, with what is seen by his
contemporaries as the Commission's "great merit, which is to evidence
the existence of the necessary elements for the creation of industry,"
implying a focus on craft traditions that are already somewhat close to
modern Brazilian society [@exposicao:1861-246, 1].

Meanwhile, Portugal is emerging from a traumatic political and economic
restructuring after the civil war of 1828--1832, and her intellectuals
are contemplating their country's uninspiring prospects as a waning
colonial power [@toussaint:2012arquitectura, 100]. On both shores of the
Atlantic, political and infrastructural modernization becomes a concern
far more pressing than the affirmation of national identity.
Nevertheless, modernization itself, along with the political crisis of
the late nineteenth century, is to become a catalyst for a renewed
interest in national identity---this time around, in the form of longing
for the lost roots of cultural identity. The historian of Portuguese
anthropology, João Leal, suggests this interest is due to Portugal's
increasingly peripheral status among European powers, pushing
nationalist thinkers to contend with "a 'classic national problem' ...
that not only favored the study of local folk traditions, but also
conducted that study as part of a search for Portuguese national
identity." [@leal:1999history26, 10--11]. This "anthropology of
nation-building" [@stocking:1982afterword47, 172] is therefore akin to
that of a newly independent country, such as Brazil's own. Now, this
operation of anthropological nation-building requires as much the making
of a conceptual scaffold as it needs the primary research to fill it
with content. Therefore, both in Portugal and in Brazil, initial efforts
at documentation are somewhat superficial if compared to the crafting of
basic narrative structures for this documentation to tie into.

Up until the 1860s, then, the actual form of the built environment has
been of little consequence to the literary debates around national
character. As the unstable political and cultural climate of the liberal
monarchies in both Portugal and Brazil wears on through the second half
of the nineteenth century, however, the tension rises between the
endeavors of, on the one hand, *documenting* national culture as
traditionally attested in popular art and, on the other hand, *creating*
works of high art that are able to express this culture while, at the
same time, being endowed with the originality of creative genius. In
both Portugal and Brazil, already in the 1860s, literary and artistic
elites grow insecure about the path of nation-building through which the
Romanticist generation confidently forged ahead. The forward-looking
"history" of Portuguese-language nations, prevalent from the 1830s to
50s, thus gives way to a comprehensive search *backwards* for the roots
of Portuguese ethnicity as well as for markers of originality in
Brazilian culture. Architects will play a cautious, yet more active role
in this process, at some times even stepping back altogether from the
issue of national character, at other times expressing a derivative,
aesthetic aspect of debates played out away from their disciplinary
field.

The conflict between the two contradictory Romanticist
strands---originality and traditional, popular authority---is resolved,
at first, into a renewed interest in artists' biographies. Though quite
similar in form to the Vasarian lives, these biographies, especially
around the 1860s, are produced in a literary environment that values the
artist's connections to the social conditions of his craft. Rodrigo José
Ferreira Brettas (1815--1866), a public official and politician in the
Brazilian hinterland province of Minas Gerais, writes in 1858 a
biography of the local rococo architect, Antonio Francisco Lisboa (ca.
1738--1814), known as "Aleijadinho," that is quite conservative in its
rhetorical devices [@bretas:1951antonio]. It relies heavily on the
well-established, by then, Romanticist trope of the tormented prodigy
whose single-minded obsession with art leads him to experience financial
hardship and even physical decay [@grammont:2008aleijadinho]; this is
interspersed with a good measure of classical references to Zeuxis and
Praxiteles. What is novel in Brettas's work is his repeated highlighting
of the fact that the protagonist of such a semi-mythical story should be
an obscurely trained craftsman, black and thus of low social standing in
hinterland society, rather than a socially respectable and well traveled
(for education) artist from Rio or Bahia, as were Araújo Porto-Alegre's
favored characters.[^2]

Likewise, the 1869 biographical notice on the neoclassical architect
from Rio, Valentim da Fonseca e Silva (1744--1813) by Manuel Duarte
Moreira de Azevedo (1832--1903) draws heavily on Araújo Porto-Alegre's
earlier account of the same artist [@moreiraazevedo:1869valentimXXXII;
@araujoportoalegre:1956iconographiaXIX], yet introduces a few
significant details. These have to do, chiefly, with the subject's
character and material hardship; when confronted with Brettas's
biography of the Aleijadinho, these passages seem oddly formulaic.
Missing from Moreira de Azevedo's narrative are Araújo Porto-Alegre's
specific commentaries on Valentim's mastery of sculptural modeling and
on the exemplary nature of his work for modern students. Instead,
Moreira de Azevedo's note begins with a passionate patriotic digression:

> In colonial times, when Brazil was not yet a nation, neither having an
> existence of her own, nor enjoying liberty or fundamental rights,
> there appeared some remarkable artists, who were their own masters,
> enlightening and ennobling the homeland, and who began to nationalize
> art, endowing their works with a type, a character, a local and
> particular tone. [@moreiraazevedo:1869valentimXXXII, 235]

These opening lines set the tone to which the remainder of the biography
is to be read. Valentim is presented not as the individual and inspiring
artist of the Vasarian formula, nor as a Romantic, inimitable genius,
but rather as a special case of the "type" of patriotic artist who
prefigures political independence through artistic "nationalization."
His personal achievements are therefore recorded not so much for their
own sake as to illustrate the general spirit of Brazilian art. Even the
statement on colonial domination is less of a specific attack on
Portugal than a standard rhetorical device intended to contrast the
initial naked ground with the later sprouting of national spirit.

For all these moves towards the portrayal of the individual architect as
a hypostasis of national character, though, the biographical genre in
the late 1860s still clings to its anecdotal medium in order to convey a
general message. Starting in the 1870s, this genre will split into two
different research techniques: strict philological and historiographic
research on individual people and sources, on the one hand, and on the
other ethnographic documentation and interpretation of popular
traditions.

Traditionalist Aims and Ethnographic Methods
============================================

Even as the artist biography is being developed into a medium for
architectural writers to explore the relationship between particular and
national characters, the documentation of actual, historical styles of
architecture in Portugal becomes a legitimate endeavor both as a support
for revivalist design and as one among many sources of ethnographic
research. The former goal is spurred by a detailed description of the
Jerónimos monastery in Belém, near Lisbon, written in 1842 by the
Brazilian military engineer and distinguished IHGB historian, Francisco
Adolfo de Varnhagen (1816--1878) [@varnhagen:1842noticia]. This and a
number of other factors, including King consort Ferdinand II's artistic
patronage, entail a belated and somewhat derivative Medieval revival
that spreads through Portugal and Brazil. At first, the capacity and
demand for revivalist buildings both in Medieval and Classical styles is
concentrated among foreign designers, such as the Austrian baron and
industrialist Wilhelm von Eschwege (1777--1855)---who traveled
extensively through Brazil and Portugal before drawing up the plans for
the Pena palace---, and foreign patrons, such as the British-dominated
Oporto Commercial Association (incorporated 1834).[^3] By the 1860s,
however, a growing domestic demand for neo-Medieval and Neo-Islamic
buildings, as well as for the restoration of existing monuments
[@anacleto:1997arquitectura, vol. 1, p. 208], drives the operative need
for the systematic study of historic Portuguese architecture. The first
questions in this study are then: where to look for this historic
architecture, and how to look at it.

The Beaux-Arts architectural method, which by the second half of the
nineteenth century is well established in the Portuguese-speaking world
[@franca:1967arte2], provides a practical foundation to the second
question---how to document historic buildings---, if one accessible only
to a small elite of formally educated architects. Nevertheless, this
practical method does not afford guidance for selecting, interpreting,
evaluating, and transfiguring the meanings of, a body of national
heritage that has yet to be grasped in a systematic way at the time
[@rosmaninho:1993historiografia]. Conversely, the intent of
nineteenth-century literary studies, that of constructing an overarching
ethnographic narrative of national identity cutting across all forms of
literary and material culture, requires, among other specialties, an
understanding of architectural principles. These complementary features
of architecture and ethnography bring the two disciplines once again
closer together over the last quarter of the century under the umbrella
of anthropological nation-building.

Around 1870, literary and philological studies stand at the
methodological fulcrum of ethnography in the Portuguese-speaking world.
Two books published that same year set the tone for debates that will
remain active until the early twentieth century. Theophilo Braga's
*History of Portuguese Literature: an Introduction,* a book so
influential it will be revised and reedited several times in the
following decades [@braga:1870historia], is also among the most
controversial works on ethnological theories and methods. Braga
(1843--1924), formally educated in Philosophy, is concerned with
establishing a positivistic methodological synthesis of his earlier
research, relating Portuguese-language literature to the ethnic makeup
and historical evolution of the Portuguese people [^4]. Augusto Filipe
Simões's *Relics of Romano-Byzantine Architecture in Portugal*
[@simoes:1870reliquias] provides a propaedeutics of sorts to the
contemporary rush to document, interpret, and appropriate Romanesque
ornament harking back to the very origins of the Portuguese state.
Simões (1835--1884), a librarian at the venerable University of Coimbra,
produces, at its core, an interpretation of the architectural heritage
of his hometown, though one that is firmly grounded in prior scholarship
as well as in archaeological and formal analysis
[@botelho:2010historiografia, 140--142]. Although these two books have
quite opposite starting points and methodological principles, both
signal the dominant trends in architectural discourse for the remainder
of the nineteenth century and, as far as traditionalist movements are
concerned, well into the twentieth.

The common point between Braga's broad ethnic brush and Simões's
detailed archaeological account is a reversal of the conventional
hierarchies of high art and popular culture. The paradigm of "great men"
and "great works" that guided earlier writings, from Araújo Porto-Alegre
to Varnhagen, is replaced by an ultimately collective cultural heritage.
"The people, writes Braga, is the anonymous one in every great work of
humanity" [@braga:1867cancioneiro, vi]. Even Almeida Garrett's
transfiguration of popular poetry at the hands of the Romantic genius
sounds conservative and elitist by Braga's standards. Though working, as
his predecessors, from the standpoint of a search for national identity,
he is chiefly interested, according to Leal, in "evaluating high
literature in the light of its greater or lesser fidelity to the
traditional [i.e., vernacular] element." [@leal:2006contos, 60]
Moreover, this fidelity is to be the "touchstone" of a "regeneration of
contemporary literature, in the sense of strengthening in it the
traditional and national element." [@leal:2006contos, 60] These tropes
will, of course, sound familiar to the student of the traditionalist
manifestos in architecture that shall take hold in Portugal a few
decades later, at the turn of the century.

Braga's search for this "traditional and national element" leads him to
the formulation of one of his most controversial claims about the ethnic
origins of the Portuguese people: the "theory of *mozarabism*." After
acknowledging from the start the common linguistic and philological
knowledge of the early nineteenth century, namely that
Portuguese-language popular literature can be traced back, in its
earliest discernible form, to the far north of Portugal in the twelfth
century [@braga:1867historia, 6], he juxtaposes it to a lesser claim
found in Herculano's nationalist *History of Portugal,* and makes it
into a central tenet of his ethnic theory. This claim concerns the
existence of a *mozarabic race*, made up of the descendants of
Wisigothic peasants assimilated into the dominant Arab society of the
eighth to thirteenth centuries [@braga:1870historia, 52--53]. This dual
origin of Portuguese culture---on the one hand strictly genealogical,
linguistic, aristocratic, and northern, and on the other hand
miscegenated, material, popular, and reminiscent of a pan-Mediterranean
ideal---is so schematic and structured it does not withstand
confrontation to the complexity of actual literary traditions or
historical processes. This weakness is exploited by several of Braga's
often ill-intentioned detractors, among them the Brazilian literary
historian and white supremacist, Sylvio Romero (1851--1914)
[@romero:1906patria].

Romero's rejection of *mozarabism* hinges on the Brazilian author's
insistence on a single strand of national evolution reaching back from
the origins of Portuguese ethnicity down to modern Brazilian culture.
Their opposition thus clouds deeper similarities: Romero is of the same
opinion as Braga regarding the primacy of popular "traditions" over
"decadent" elitism [@romero:1882introduccao, 11]. Yet, because national
unity through tradition is Romero's chief concern---not to mention his
beliefs on racial evolutionism---, he finds it impossible to accept a
theory that posits two distinct "spirits" of Portuguese-language
literature. The factual and theoretical fragility of Braga's theory of
*mozarabism* thus becomes, thanks in part to his detractors' nervous
refutations [@martins:1953teoriaXXVIII], a source of adaptability.
Despite the fact that Braga himself eventually reneges on the original
formulation of his theory, then, it proves to be a rather powerful and
flexible concept supporting two parallel strands of architectural
traditionalism in Portugal and Brazil.

Emergence of Professional Discourses
====================================

The transition from literary debates that imply issues relative to
architecture and material culture to architectural discourses framed by
a disciplinary background in architecture, art history, or archaeology
takes place in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Simões's account of Romanesque architecture is a counterpoint to the
sharply ideological and polarizing work of Braga. Simões's book is a
true work of art history in the modern disciplinary sense. It combines a
rigorous critique of written sources with sharp visual analysis of the
built fabric, and does not shy away from making sweeping, though at
times unwarranted, generalizations out of this critique and analysis.
Such generalizations never go as far as Braga's, however, and in
Simões's book one is left mainly with some archaeological support for
the northern origins of Portuguese culture---even if those origins are
due simply to the circumstances of state formation in the Iberian
peninsula not some transcendental ethnic scheme. Despite its analytical
merits, his work is better understood as part of a general development
of philological and archaeological art history, even better represented
by the work of Joaquim de Vasconcellos, which culminates in an ambitious
*Artistic ethnography* [@vasconcelos:1916etnografia]. A number of
architects and engineers gravitate, starting in the late 1870s, towards
this kind of archaeological scholarship, among them the illustrious
academician and teacher Possidónio Narciso, who in his ripe old age will
put forth a synthetic textbook on the history of Western European
architecture [@silva:1878nocoes]. It will be the final decade of the
nineteenth century, however, before a clear architectural formulation of
literary traditionalism emerges.

Oftentimes, rather than emulating the basic methods of data collection
performed by ethnographers and literary historians, architectural
theories will build upon the higher-order interpretations and even upon
the general conclusions laid out in this scholarship.
