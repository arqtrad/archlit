  This article outlines a history of architectural theory in Portugal
  and Brazil during the nineteenth century, arguing that such theory is
  contained within the social circle and methodological scope of
  literary history. It does so by following the architectural
  discourses of writers, literary critics, and ethnographers. This
  results in an evolving landscape of architectural references and of
  methods with which to approach the built environment, while also
  raising challenges for the cross-disciplinary appropriation of
  architectural theories.

Introduction
============

The critique of architectural character in Portugal and Brazil from the
mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries derives much of its
motivation and methodology from literary history and criticism.
Moreover, it plays out to a great extent within literary circles, even
as a Portuguese-language architectural press emerges during the Belle
Époque. This context has made the rise of architectural theory in these
two nations virtually invisible to a historiography still mostly
concerned with the study of strictly disciplinary texts.[^1]

Beginning in the age of liberal monarchies in both countries, around the
mid-1830s, Romanticist writers are involved with the theoretical
formulation of a concept of national identity to which aesthetic
experience is central. This concept slowly extends to encompass the
visual and building arts. Along the way, writers grapple with the
articulation between the civilizational goals of Beaux-Arts education,
on one hand, and the cultural legitimacy of nonacademic forms of
expression documented in ethnographic research, on the other. This
process, spurred by nationalist Romanticism in the 1840s and 50s, peaks
in the ethnographic and biographical writings produced by the
"generation of 1870" [@alonso:2002ideias]. By the turn of the century,
this literary buildup of approaches to art history and national
character irrupts into texts that deal specifically with architecture.

This last stage has been profusely studied in recent scholarship,
exposing the social and professional networks that support
traditionalist architects such as Ricardo Severo and Raul Lino, as well
as the beginnings of historic preservation [@mello:2007ricardo;
@fernandes:2016olhando23; @pinheiro:2006historia].
Conversely, the historical and literary discourses of nationalist
Romanticists (1840s--50s) and of the 1870 generation (up to the turn of
the century) have long been a staple subject in the history of ideas
during the age of constitutional monarchies in Portugal and Brazil
[@guimaraes:1988nacao1; @carvalho:2013construcao; @boto:2001cultura35;
@torgal:1998historia]. Such works have shown how specifically
Brazilian concerns regarding the creation of a national identity through
historiography in the mid-nineteenth century
[@guimaraes:2002amadorismo3] resonate with contemporary Portuguese
nationalist writers [@dalge:1999relacoes3]. They also have shed light on
turn-of-the-century debates on the causal relationships among race,
language, and cultural identity [@pereira:1992racas14;
@rodriguez:2017moral]. Going beyond the expected affirmation of national
identity in each country, these debates evidence the workings of a
transatlantic *republic of letters* bridging the conceptual and
ideological divide caused by Brazilian independence
[@paredes:2006querela32].

Compared to this flourishing universe of literary history,
Portuguese-language architectural theory in the strict sense, and
especially Brazilian theory, is generally held to be a late
bloomer.[^7] Because of this, the traditionalist movement of the early
twentieth century has been tacitly assumed to spring, fully armed, from
its contemporary context of modernization in Portugal's and Brazil's
late monarchical and early Republican period (roughly 1890--1910). This
assumption is compounded by a projection of present-day disciplinary
boundaries upon earlier periods; according to a prevalent view, if any
sources of architectural theory are to be found in the nineteenth
century, these must be sought in discourses about urban reforms
[@salgueiro:2001cidades; @lisboa:2002engenheiros] not historical
writing. This view has reserved an uneasy place for traditionalist
architecture. Though it is understood to play a role in the ideological
underpinning of Republican nationalism [@mello:2007ricardo], it is
difficult to shake off the interpretation that, in hindsight,
traditionalism was somehow doomed from the start to be a methodological
dead end [@comas:2010passado; @rosmaninho:2002casa].

I seek to show in this article how traditionalist architecture
in Portugal and Brazil has a longer historical background and clearer
theoretical roots than some of the scholarship tends to assume.
Portuguese-speaking architects and architectural critics appropriate the
goals and perspectives by literary historians, formulated long before
the rise of traditionalist architectural styles. This appropriation can
be seen in an implicit dialog between Belle Époque architectural
traditionalism and ethnographic portrayals of national character
construed throughout the second half of the nineteenth century. The
traditionalist movement's claim to authority thus rests on a double
reach for the past: first, it requires "traditional architecture" to
pre-exist its turn-of-the-century reconstruction in Portugal and Brazil,
exhibiting stability through space and time; to prove this claim, it
reaches for a respectable apparatus of literary and historical
criticism, crafted throughout the nineteenth century.

Architectural Theory as Literary Genre
======================================

The literary milieu is quite
distinct from that of the engineering and infrastructure debates arising
around the same time, and far less popular among, or methodologically
accessible to, architectural historians. The disciplinary corps of
architecture, ever on the lookout for "pioneers" of modernity, has
focused overwhelmingly on the technical and political aspects of urban
reform [@lisboa:2002engenheiros; @salgueiro:2001cidades] or, at best, on
the built outcomes of socioeconomic change [@lemos:1999republica;
@depaoli:2013entre]. Even as a growing body of social and literary
historians have sought to interpret writers' experiences of the urban
environment [@acerbi:2014long; @aragao:2012passeio;
@colonetti:2007selecao3; @pedruzzi:2008rio3; @resende:2016lima;
@schwarcz:2017minha31; @staudt:2009rio], the influence of literary
history, as well as of the methods of ethnographic critique that stem
from it in the late nineteenth century, in shaping a theory of
architecture is still mostly overlooked.

It is true that, in contrast to the world of civil and social
engineering, architectural theory remains, well into the nineteenth
century, something for the "learned enjoyment" of well-to-do men (seldom
women) of letters. Such is the target audience for João Pacheco's 1734
compendium of cultural and scientific trivia
[@pacheco:1734divertimento], a staple of aristocratic libraries for a
long time thereafter [@macedo:2017biblioteca]. As late as 1823, a
posthumous work by the Portuguese court architect, Cyrillo Volkmar
Machado (1748--1823) recommends the study of his Vasarian biographies of
artists to "polite" and "learned" men, that is, to the well-born
dilettante [@machado:1922colleccao, 1]. Conversely, many professional
architects shy away from these elevated circles, or else establish a
fitting ethos in their writing by styling themselves poets, journalists,
or scientists, rather than men of the trade. Such is the case of the
Portuguese architect, archaeologist, and academician, Joaquim Possidónio
Narciso da Silva (1806--1896), as well as of the Brazilian architect,
poet, and diplomat, Manuel de Araújo Porto-Alegre (1806--1879), both of
whom are well versed in science and literature, and have inroads to
their respective royal and imperial courts.

Architectural culture nevertheless thrives within literary---and, by
extension, historical---circles throughout the nineteenth century, and
muster from it a methodological apparatus as well as a set of historical
references pertaining to the questions of national character and
tradition. A young Araújo Porto-Alegre addresses these questions in what
is among the earliest studies on Brazilian art, a report read before the
Institut Historique in Paris in 1834. His account of colonial
architecture (seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) concocts for it a
commendable Renaissance genealogy that "evidences ... the taste of the
new Roman school of Bramante and Buonarroti" and displays even, in one
church, "as if a distant reflection of the admirable frescos of the
Vatican" [@magalhaes:1834resume, 50] ([@Fig:riocolonia]). Not content
with relating Brazilian architecture directly to Italian sources, Araújo
Porto-Alegre goes so far as to frame its achievements as an unlikely
triumph over the hindrance of Portuguese philistinism
[@magalhaes:1834resume, 50]. This claim sets in motion a nationalist
debate on the relationship between Portuguese tradition and Brazilian
particularity that will last for upwards of a century.

The prescriptive definition of national character in art requires, of
course, a documented body of knowledge on what national art is to begin
with. At this point, the two strands of Romanticism tug in opposite
directions: on one side is the drive for personal originality,
represented by Araújo Porto-Alegre; on the other, nationalist
revivalism, represented by the Portuguese writers, João Baptista da
Silva Leitão de Almeida Garrett (1799--1854) and Alexandre Herculano
(1810--1877) [@botelho:2010historiografia, 121]. The Brazilian master
shifts the burden of building a Brazilian artistic "School" towards the
future and onto the Beaux-Arts education provided by the Imperial
Academy of Fine Arts (AIBA). As its director from 1854 to 1857, he
commands a comprehensive program reform that puts at its center the
Romanticist principle of fostering creative originality rather than
academic conformity to a traditional body of knowledge [@lima:2016digne,
n. 3]. In his articles for the journal of the Brazilian Historic and
Geographic Institute (IHGB), Araújo Porto-Alegre therefore follows the
Vasarian biographic scheme also prevalent in Portugal
[@rosmaninho:1993historiografia, 3], describing the artistic
developments in the Brazilian capital as the accumulated contributions
of each individual artist's genius [@araujoportoalegre:1841memoriaIII].
As late as 1855, he carries on the prospective ideal of art history as
spiritual and technical inspiration rather than a documental trove
constituting a source of aesthetic authority:
"My attempt targeted a national thought, namely that of using these
examples to make other [ideas] of higher value bear fruit in the young
minds." [@araujoportoalegre:1856iconographiaXIX, 349]

Araújo Porto-Alegre's effort will reach its
culmination under the late-nineteenth-century generation of artists and
theoreticians, at the forefront of which stands the novelist and art
critic, Luís Gonzaga Duque Estrada (1863--1911). Due to this focus on
creative originality as a precondition for an authentic national style,
Gonzaga Duque will be chiefly interested in the social and cultural
conditions surrounding the production of art and architecture, rather
than in architectural forms strictly speaking [@guimaraes:2001empenho,
23]. Therefore, his anticlerical opinions lead him, in his early history
of Brazilian art, to dismiss the mannerist style of early Jesuitic
architecture as "evidently lacking in taste" [@gonzagaduque:1995arte].
That one of the few opinions on architecture to come out of Araújo
Porto-Alegre's "spiritual lineage" should be such a curt judgment on the
subject is evidence of the low value ascribed to primary documentation
in this critical circle.

The Portuguese Romanticist writers, on the other hand, place increasing
emphasis on the documentation of sources not only for historical
writing, Herculano's lifelong effort, but even for literary creation.
Almeida Garrett dedicates much of his early work, compiled in the 1843
*Romanceiro geral,* to reinterpretations of popular poetry
[@monteiro:2019refiguracoes9]. His 1844 poem *Miragaia,* described in the
foreword as "a true reconstruction of an ancient monument"
[@almeidagarrett:1844miragaia], is illustrated with compelling etchings
([@Fig:miragaia])
of Gothic and Islamic architecture by Manuel Bordallo Pinheiro
(1815--1880), evidencing their interest in a comprehensive historical
ambiance that ranges from the purported authenticity of the text to its
pictorial decoration.

Another scion of this Romanticist circle, the
Brazilian-born poet, Antonio Gonçalves Dias (1823--1864) takes this
interest one step further. After completing his studies in Portugal,
Gonçalves Dias returns to Brazil thoroughly imbued with the nationalist
emphasis on documentation promoted by Almeida Garrett and Herculano. In
1859, Gonçalves Dias is entrusted with the "ethnography and narrative
section" of the Scientific Commission of Exploration, an expedition to
the Northeast Brazilian province of Ceará that seeks to document various
social and natural features of that region. This Commission, established
under the aegis of the 
IHGB, will ultimately expose the conflicts inherent to the framing of
national identity as something to be both *documented* and *created* in
a single literary or artistic process.

The crux of the conflict that arises together with ethnographic
documentation in Portugal and Brazil has to do with the authority
attributed to sources and methods. The process by which writers have
traditionally acknowledged authority, based on cross-examination of the
classics, is challenged by the rising prestige of popular literature,
championed by Almeida Garrett, as well as by increasing competition
between historians of literature and natural scientists for the
legitimacy to describe social and ethnic groups. In this context, it is
perhaps not surprising Gonçalves Dias should eventually fall out with
the Expedition's leader, physician and zoologist Manuel Ferreira Lagos
(1816--1870), who seems to consider the ethnographic section as being
of lesser importance than zoology, botany, and mineralogy
[@kury:2001comissao, 39].

Gonçalves Dias's insistence on fulfilling the
Commission's original goal of studying all of Brazil's northerly
provinces, even as when the other sections' work is called off after
documenting a single province, further exposes these conflicts. He
collects products from communities descended both from native groups and
from Portuguese colonists, "far beyond the confines of ...
civilization," as one major Rio newspaper reports [@exposicao:1861-246,
1], and scours the Amazon region looking for non acculturated native
communities. This is at odds, however, with what is seen by his
contemporaries as the Commission's "great merit, which is to evidence
the existence of the necessary elements for the creation of industry,"
implying a focus on craft traditions that are already somewhat close to
modern Brazilian society [@exposicao:1861-246, 1].

Cultural Nation-building in Crisis
==================================

Meanwhile, Portugal is emerging from a traumatic political and economic
restructuring after the civil war of 1828--1832, and her intellectuals
are contemplating their country's uninspiring prospects as a waning
colonial power [@toussaint:2012arquitectura, 100]. On both shores of the
Atlantic, political and infrastructural modernization becomes a concern
far more pressing than the affirmation of national identity.
Nevertheless, modernization itself, along with the political crisis of
the late nineteenth century, is to become a catalyst for a renewed
interest in national identity---this time around, in the form of longing
for the lost roots of cultural identity. The historian of Portuguese
anthropology, João Leal, suggests this interest is due to Portugal's
increasingly peripheral status among European powers, pushing
nationalist thinkers to contend with "a 'classic national problem' ...
that not only favored the study of local folk traditions, but also
conducted that study as part of a search for Portuguese national
identity" [@leal:1999history26, 10--11]. This "anthropology of
nation-building" [@stocking:1982afterword47, 172] is therefore akin to
that of a newly independent country, such as Brazil's own. Now, this
operation of anthropological nation-building requires as much the making
of a conceptual scaffold as it needs the primary research to fill it
with content. Therefore, both in Portugal and in Brazil, initial efforts
at documentation are somewhat superficial if compared to the crafting of
basic narrative structures for this documentation to tie into.

Up until the 1860s, then, the actual form of the built environment has
been of little consequence to the literary debates around national
character. As the unstable political and cultural climate of the liberal
monarchies in both Portugal and Brazil wears on through the second half
of the nineteenth century, however, the tension rises between the
endeavors of, on the one hand, *documenting* national culture as
traditionally attested in popular art and, on the other hand, *creating*
works of high art that are able to express this culture while, at the
same time, being endowed with the originality of creative genius. In
both Portugal and Brazil, already in the 1860s, literary and artistic
elites grow insecure about the path of nation-building through which the
Romanticist generation confidently forged ahead. The forward-looking
"history" of Portuguese-language nations, prevalent from the 1830s to
50s, thus gives way to a comprehensive search *backwards* for the roots
of Portuguese ethnicity as well as for markers of originality in
Brazilian culture. Architects will play a cautious, yet more active role
in this process, at some times even stepping back altogether from the
issue of national character, at other times expressing a derivative,
aesthetic aspect of debates played out away from their disciplinary
field.

The conflict between the two contradictory Romanticist
strands---originality and traditional, popular authority---is resolved,
at first, into a renewed interest in artists' biographies. Though quite
similar in form to the Vasarian lives, these biographies, especially
around the 1860s, are produced in a literary environment that values the
artist's connections to the social conditions of his craft and that
begin to break free of attachment to the conventional cradles of "high
art"---the capitals and major coastal cities in Portugal and Brazil. In
this spirit, Rodrigo José Ferreira Brettas (1815--1866), a public
official and politician in the Brazilian hinterland province of Minas
Gerais, writes in 1858 a biography of the local rococo architect,
Antonio Francisco Lisboa (ca. 1738--1814), known as "Aleijadinho." It is
quite conservative in its rhetorical devices [@bretas:1951antonio],
relying heavily on the well-established, by then, Romanticist trope of
the tormented prodigy whose single-minded obsession with art leads him
to experience financial hardship and even physical decay
[@grammont:2008aleijadinho]. What is novel in Brettas's work is his
repeated highlighting of the fact that the protagonist of such a
semi-mythical story should be an obscurely trained craftsman, black and
thus of low social standing in hinterland society, rather than a
socially respectable and well traveled (for education) artist from Rio
or Bahia, as were Araújo Porto-Alegre's favored characters.[^2]

Likewise, the 1869 biographical notice on the neoclassical architect
from Rio, Valentim da Fonseca e Silva (1744--1813) by Manuel Duarte
Moreira de Azevedo (1832--1903) draws heavily on Araújo Porto-Alegre's
earlier account of the same artist [@moreiraazevedo:1869valentimXXXII;
@araujoportoalegre:1856iconographiaXIX], yet introduces a few
significant details. These have to do, chiefly, with the subject's
character and material hardship; when confronted with Brettas's
biography of the Aleijadinho, these passages seem oddly formulaic.
Missing from Moreira de Azevedo's narrative are Araújo Porto-Alegre's
specific commentaries on Valentim's mastery of sculptural modeling and
on the exemplary nature of his work for modern students. Instead,
Moreira de Azevedo's note begins with a passionate patriotic digression:

> In colonial times, when Brazil was not yet a nation, neither having an
> existence of her own, nor enjoying liberty or fundamental rights,
> there appeared some remarkable artists, who were their own masters,
> enlightening and ennobling the homeland, and who began to nationalize
> art, endowing their works with a type, a character, a local and
> particular tone. [@moreiraazevedo:1869valentimXXXII, 235]

These opening lines set the tone to which the remainder of the biography
is to be read. Valentim is presented not as the individual and inspiring
artist of the Vasarian formula, nor as a Romantic, inimitable genius,
but rather as a special case of the "type" of patriotic artist who
prefigures political independence through artistic "nationalization."
His personal achievements are therefore recorded not so much for their
own sake as to illustrate the general spirit of Brazilian art. Even the
statement on colonial domination is less of a specific attack on
Portugal than a standard rhetorical device intended to contrast the
initial naked ground with the later sprouting of national spirit.

For all these moves towards the portrayal of the individual architect as
a hypostasis of national character, though, the biographical genre in
the late 1860s still clings to its anecdotal medium in order to convey a
general message. Starting in the 1870s, this genre will split into two
different research techniques: strict philological and historiographic
research on individual people and sources, on the one hand, and on the
other ethnographic documentation and interpretation of popular
traditions.

Even as the artist biography is being developed into a medium for
architectural writers to explore the relationship between particular and
national characters, the documentation of actual, historical styles of
architecture in Portugal becomes a legitimate endeavor both as a support
for revivalist design and as one among many sources of ethnographic
research. The former goal is spurred by a detailed description of the
monastery of the Hieronymites in Belém ([@Fig:belem]), near Lisbon, written in
1842 by the Brazilian military engineer and IHGB historian, Francisco
Adolfo de Varnhagen (1816--1878) [@varnhagen:1842noticia]. This and a
number of other factors, including King consort Ferdinand II's artistic
patronage, entail a belated and somewhat derivative Medieval revival
that spreads through Portugal and Brazil.

At first, the capacity and
demand for revivalist buildings both in Medieval and Classical styles is
concentrated among foreign designers, such as the Austrian baron and
industrialist Wilhelm von Eschwege (1777--1855)---who traveled
extensively through Brazil and Portugal before drawing up the plans for
Ferdinand II's Pena Summer palace ([@Fig:pena])---, and foreign patrons, such as the
British-dominated Oporto Commercial Association (incorporated 1834).[^3]
By the 1860s, however, a growing domestic demand for neo-Medieval and
Neo-Islamic buildings, as well as for the restoration of existing
monuments [@anacleto:1997arquitectura, vol. 1, p. 208], drives the
operative need for the systematic study of historic Portuguese
architecture. The first questions in this study are then: where to look
for this historic architecture, and how to look at it.

The Beaux-Arts architectural method, which by the second half of the
nineteenth century is well established in the Portuguese-speaking world
[@franca:1967arte2], provides a practical foundation to the second
question---how to document historic buildings---, if one accessible only
to a small elite of formally educated architects. Nevertheless, this
practical method does not afford guidance for selecting, interpreting,
evaluating, and transfiguring the meanings of, a body of national
heritage that has yet to be grasped in a systematic way at the time
[@rosmaninho:1993historiografia]. Conversely, the intent of
nineteenth-century literary studies, that of constructing an overarching
ethnographic narrative of national identity cutting across all forms of
literary and material culture, requires, among other specialties, an
understanding of architectural principles. These complementary features
of architecture and ethnography bring the two disciplines once again
closer together over the last quarter of the century under the umbrella
of anthropological nation-building.

Traditionalist Aims and Ethnographic Methods
============================================

Around 1870, literary and philological studies stand at the
methodological fulcrum of ethnography in the Portuguese-speaking world.
Two books published that same year set the tone for debates that will
remain active until the early twentieth century. Theophilo Braga's
*History of Portuguese Literature: an Introduction,* a book so
influential it will be revised and reedited several times in the
following decades [@braga:1870historia], is also among the most
controversial works on ethnological theories and methods. Braga
(1843--1924), formally educated in Philosophy, is concerned with
establishing a positivistic methodological synthesis of his earlier
research, relating Portuguese-language literature to the ethnic makeup
and historical evolution of the Portuguese people [^4]. Augusto Filipe
Simões's *Relics of Romano-Byzantine Architecture in Portugal*
[@simoes:1870reliquias] provides a propaedeutics of sorts to the
contemporary rush to document, interpret, and appropriate Romanesque
ornament harking back to the very origins of the Portuguese state.
Simões (1835--1884), a librarian at the venerable University of Coimbra,
produces, at its core, an interpretation of the architectural heritage
of his hometown, though one that is firmly grounded in prior scholarship
as well as in archaeological and formal analysis
[@botelho:2010historiografia, 140--142]. Although these two books have
quite opposite starting points and methodological principles, both
signal the dominant trends in architectural discourse for the remainder
of the nineteenth century and, as far as traditionalist movements are
concerned, well into the twentieth.

The common point between Braga's broad ethnic brush and Simões's
detailed archaeological account is a reversal of the conventional
hierarchies of high art and popular culture. The paradigm of "great men"
and "great works" that guided earlier writings, from Araújo Porto-Alegre
to Varnhagen, is replaced by an ultimately collective cultural heritage.
"The people, writes Braga, is the anonymous one in every great work of
humanity" [@braga:1867cancioneiro, vi]. Even Almeida Garrett's
transfiguration of popular poetry at the hands of the Romantic genius
sounds conservative and elitist by Braga's standards. Though working, as
his predecessors, from the standpoint of a search for national identity,
he is chiefly interested, according to Leal, in "evaluating high
literature in the light of its greater or lesser fidelity to the
traditional [i.e., vernacular] element." [@leal:2006contos, 60]
Furthermore, this fidelity is to be the "touchstone" of a "regeneration
of contemporary literature, in the sense of strengthening in it the
traditional and national element." [@leal:2006contos, 60] These tropes
will, of course, sound familiar to the student of the traditionalist
manifestos in architecture that shall take hold in Portugal a few
decades later, at the turn of the century.

Braga's search for this "traditional and national element" leads him to
the formulation of one of his most controversial claims about the ethnic
origins of the Portuguese people: the "theory of *mozarabism*." After
acknowledging from the start the common linguistic and philological
knowledge of the early nineteenth century, namely that
Portuguese-language popular literature can be traced back, in its
earliest discernible form, to the far north of Portugal in the twelfth
century [@braga:1867historia, 6], he juxtaposes it to a lesser claim
found in Herculano's nationalist *History of Portugal,* and makes it
into a central tenet of his ethnic theory. This claim concerns the
existence of a *mozarabic race*, made up of the descendants of
Wisigothic peasants assimilated into the dominant Arab society of the
eighth to thirteenth centuries.[^5] This dual origin of Portuguese
culture---on the one hand strictly genealogical, linguistic,
aristocratic, and northern, and on the other hand miscegenated,
material, popular, and reminiscent of a pan-Mediterranean ideal---is so
schematic and structured it does not withstand confrontation to the
complexity of actual literary traditions or historical processes. This
weakness is exploited by several of Braga's often ill-intentioned
detractors, among them the Brazilian literary historian and white
supremacist, Sylvio Romero (1851--1914) [@romero:1906patria].

Romero's rejection of *mozarabism* hinges on the Brazilian author's
insistence on a single strand of national evolution reaching back from
the origins of Portuguese ethnicity down to modern Brazilian culture.
Their opposition thus clouds deeper similarities: Romero is of the same
opinion as Braga regarding the primacy of popular "traditions" over
"decadent" elitism [@romero:1882introduccao, 11]. Yet, because national
unity through tradition is Romero's chief concern---not to mention his
beliefs on racial evolutionism---, he finds it impossible to accept a
theory that posits two distinct "spirits" of Portuguese-language
literature. The factual and theoretical fragility of Braga's theory of
*mozarabism* thus becomes, thanks in part to his detractors' nervous
refutations [@martins:1953teoriaXXVIII], a source of adaptability.
Despite the fact that Braga himself eventually reneges on the original
formulation of his theory, then, it proves to be a rather powerful and
flexible concept supporting two parallel strands of architectural
traditionalism in Portugal and Brazil.

The transition from literary debates that imply issues relative to
architecture and material culture to architectural discourses framed by
a disciplinary background in architecture, art history, or archaeology
takes place in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Simões's account of Romanesque architecture ([@Fig:simoes]) is a
counterpoint to the sharply ideological and polarizing work of Braga.
Simões's book is a
true work of art history in the modern disciplinary sense. It combines a
rigorous critique of written sources with sharp visual analysis of the
built fabric, and does not shy away from making sweeping, though at
times unwarranted, generalizations out of this critique and analysis.
Such generalizations never go as far as Braga's, however, and in
Simões's book one is left mainly with some archaeological support for
the northern origins of Portuguese culture---even if those origins are
due simply to the circumstances of state formation in the Iberian
peninsula not some transcendental ethnic scheme.

Despite its analytical
merits, his work is better understood as part of a general development
of philological and archaeological art history, even better represented
by the work of Joaquim de Vasconcellos, which culminates in an ambitious
*Artistic ethnography* [@vasconcelos:1916etnografia]. A number of
architects and engineers gravitate, starting in the late 1870s, towards
this kind of archaeological scholarship, among them the illustrious
academician and teacher Possidónio Narciso, who in his ripe old age will
put forth a synthetic textbook on the history of Western European
architecture [@silva:1878nocoes]. It will be the final decade of the
nineteenth century, however, before a clear architectural formulation of
literary traditionalism emerges.

The architectural manifestation of traditionalism implies moving away
from the learned appropriation of historical and global styles. It thus
establishes a crucial distinction between the theoretical recognition of
Braga's theory of *mozarabism* as a parochial principle of Portuguese
identity and the figurative application of Islamicate styles within a
cosmopolitan spirit, in works of monumental architecture such as the
Pena palace or the Oporto Commercial Association Building. As the
prestige and economic standing of the aristocracy and of the wealthy
industrialists are shaken during the financial crises of the 1870s to
80s, that cosmopolitan spirit decisively gives way to the parochial
leanings of traditionalism and regionalism. The focus therefore shifts,
of necessity, from monumental architecture to dwellings: though
technically anonymous, the builders of Simões's Romanesque churches are
anything but popular as far as the nineteenth-century acknowledgment of
their achievements is concerned. Moreover, the pan-European genealogy of
architectural styles within which Portuguese Romanesque is inserted
[@silva:1878nocoes] clearly speaks of Braga's aristocratic strand rather
than of the "traditional" culture.

Traditionalist architecture is usually not a direct
transposition of the literary and ethnographic methods, however, since
its built expression is still not obvious in the late nineteenth
century.
Oftentimes, rather than emulating the basic methods of data collection
performed by ethnographers and literary historians, architectural
theories will build upon the higher-order interpretations and even upon
the general conclusions laid out in this scholarship. Moreover, at the
turn of the century, it is still more often than not a discourse that
attempts to *persuade* the architect, rather than a discourse *produced
by* the professional architect. "After all, Michel Toussaint suggests,
the architects' job was to design as artists, ... not to reflect. This
was someone else's job: art historians, aesthetic theorists, or even
engineers." [@toussaint:2012arquitectura, 145] This discourse is then,
at any rate, somewhat derivative of the literary theories and histories.
Thus, the early built work by Raul Lino (1879--1974) constitutes an
essentially formal reinterpretation of the Medieval architectural
elements codified in publications such as Simões's
[@lino:1900projectoI].

Professional Discourse and the Topography of Tradition
======================================================

Unlike the Romanticist ethnography of Gonçalves Dias's and Almeida
Garrett's generation, which was *procedural* in nature---stressing the
free reinterpretation of canonical examples, guided by artistic
genius---, the ethnographic
traditionalism of the late nineteenth century is eminently *documental*
and *iconographic* [@vigato:1994larchitecture, 52]. It must be so, first
because it requires constructing an "Other" within one's own nation as a
primeval and authentic source *separate* from the corrupting influence
of the architect's own formal education, and second because that
authentic vernacular is devoid of a canonical method, of the kind
Beaux-Arts classicism provides, and can therefore only be approached in
the form of a survey of its expressions.

Such a survey is demanded by
Enrique Casanova (1850--1913), a Spanish painter settled in Lisbon since
1880, and tentatively undertaken by the engineer turned archaeologist,
Ricardo Severo (1869--1940), first in his native Portugal, then in
Brazil. The similarity between these two men goes beyond their
architectural interests into the realm of politics, both being forced
into political exile. They are representative of a project of cultural
secularization, which leads them to shun Church and royal built heritage
in favor of popular dwelling. Traditionalist regionalism, an eminently
political movement with roots in the Catalan autonomic movement
[@sola-morales:1980eclecticismo] as well as in French "right-wing
socialism," [@vigato:1994larchitecture, 18] is therefore a privileged
arena for the expression of anti-establishment opinions.

A significant outcome of this dislocation of literary discourse into
politics will have to do with the geographic *locus* of tradition.
Braga's legacy is that of a latent tension between the nationalist
search for a hierarchical genealogy of traditional architecture and the
emerging regionalist argument for a constellation of popular traditions,
irreconcilable to a single point of origin. This tension bursts out onto
a debate around the topic of the "Portuguese house," contemporary with
other traditionalist movements throughout Europe [@rosmaninho:2002casa]
but particularly close to Spanish *andalucismo* and *mudejarismo*
[@rodriguezdomingo:1999neomudejar]. In late nineteenth-century Portugal,
there emerges, according to Regina Anacleto, an ideological argument as
to "the persistence of a grammar ... with *mudéjar* roots,"
[@anacleto:1997arquitectura, vol. 1, p. 400] distinct from the "facile
'Alhambrism' and ... gudgeon Orientalism, more visual than formal"
[@anacleto:1997arquitectura, vol. 1, p. 436] of high-art eclecticism.

Several years before the more famous manifestos by Raul Lino, a number
of short notices and journal articles tackle the matter with seemingly
cursory commentaries on the character of certain
vernacular dwellings in particular regions of Portugal. Casanova plays a
decisive part in this process, publishing two articles in the
short-lived 1895 magazine *Arte Portugueza,* which he co-edits with
Gabriel Pereira (1847--1911). The article published in the first issue
begins with the verbatim quotation of a now famous footnote in Henrique
das Neves's 1893 book, *A cava de Viriato.* [@neves:1893cava] Neves
nonchalantly mentions that "there seems to be a Portuguese type of
housing" in Trás-os-Montes, the far northwestern region of Portugal
[@casa:1895I1, 21], and leaves it at that. The first short piece in
*Arte Portugeza*, written by Pereira with drawings by Casanova
[@rodrigues:2016origens, 34] ([@Fig:casanova]) expands this comment into
a description of the main characteristics of such a "Portuguese house,"
which he holds is prevalent also further south, in the Beira Alta
region.

It is essentially
a rural building type with only a few urban derivatives. Two drawings
with this article and another five with its follow-up [@casa:1895I6]
accurately illustrate the written descriptions. In keeping with the
prevailing geographical determinism that underpins regionalist politics
and, to some degree, even the literary history of the time, it is argued
that "the house with balcony or veranda is much more pleasant and
appropriate to our changing climate than many other private houses seen
around here, which are expensive to maintain." [@casa:1895I1, 22] The
first article ends with a note of caution regarding generalization:

> The house varies, adapting to the climate, as well as to the
> inhabitant's uses. When studying the Portuguese house, we should
> distinguish the rural from the urban one. The [house] from Minho, with
> its *eido* [court], differs from the Alentejo *casal* [house cluster],
> with its backyard or its *quinchoso* [lightwell]: they differ in their
> aspect, in their hearth and chimney, in the lack or abundance of
> whitewashing, in the verandas, which in the South are like terraces.
> [@casa:1895I1, 22]

The terms that are shown emphasized in the quotation above are unusual,
archaic even, in their Portuguese original. This choice of words
evidences a conscious attempt to relate a writing style to the object
described, tributary of the naturalistic fiction of its time. By using
this device, the writer highlights the conceptual as well as geographic
distance between the traditional rural or small-town house and the
reader, presumed to be an educated and cosmopolitan urbanite.
The tension between nationalist unity and regionalist diversity in turn
plays out in the architectural and anthropological contrast between
Portuguese and Brazilian regions. In Portugal, it is the opposition in
climate and geography between North and South. In Brazil, the contrast
of Rio de Janeiro and Bahia, traditional centers of high culture,
against the remainder of the country, is being superseded, in the early
twentieth century, by a new discourse positing São Paulo both as the
historic colonial frontier, preserving a repository of traditional rural
houses, and as the frontier of modernity where this mythical history can
be reinterpreted into the professional architect's renewed links to
tradition.

The literary, political, and archaeological aspects of traditionalist
theory all come together in explicitly architectural form as a series of
lectures Ricardo Severo gives in São Paulo, his home in exile,
from 1911 to 1915. By then, Severo is already an acclaimed designer and
archaeologist, having edited and contributed his own research for the
1899--1908 ethnographic journal *Portugalia* [@severo:1899portugalia].
His own house in Porto, completed in 1904 ([@Fig:conde]), is featured
prominently in the magazine *Construcção Moderna.* He leaves his
hometown in 1908,
during the economic crisis that precedes the fall of the Portuguese
monarchy, and settles in São Paulo, a city where he had previously lived
as a republican refugee [@mascaro:2011ricardo; see also
@mello:2007ricardo]. The lectures are Severo's attempt at gaining access
to the notoriously exclusive and, to some degree, hereditary circles of
Paulista patrician society, perhaps both out of a yearning for scholarly
recognition and as a way of networking with potential clients for his
construction work. He is, therefore, speaking to a class of educated men
and women who style themselves sophisticated patrons of the arts; some
of them are successful writers in their own right who will go on to make
up much of the canon of Brazilian modernist literature.[^6]

Severo's lectures are, therefore, a carefully crafted crescendo of
concepts leading his dilettante audience step by step into the specifics
of architectural theory.
The first lecture, *Origins of the Portuguese Nation*, is delivered in
1911 and published (in Portugal) the following year. In it, he posits a
"homogeneous" Portuguese people that "remains an ethnic formula [sic]
with a distinct constitution" [@severo:1912origens, 32] largely
determined by the geographic features and seclusion of its land
[@severo:1912origens, 10]. There follows a series of two lectures
generally titled *Traditional Art in Brazil*, delivered between 1914 and
1915, and published as two separate articles. The 1914 lecture bears the
suggestive subtitle *The House and the Temple* and defends that, as
Brazil descends, in her linguistic and "moral being"
[@severo:1916arte, 7], from Portugal, so, too, her architecture must
express that descent [@severo:1916arte, 42]. The general tone of
Severo's writing is more reminiscent of Almeida Garrett's
transfiguration of traditional poetry into the modern writer's creation,
though, than of Braga's collection of raw popular sources. The 1914 and
1915 lectures are similar in spirit, with the latter [@severo:1917arte]
substituting photographs of specific historic buildings in São Paulo and
environs for most of the generic, typological sketches that illustrated
the former. This explicit reliance on a built heritage that is more
immediately familiar to Severo's audience has the secondary effect of
exposing the rising conflicts in the configuration and appropriation of
national character in early republican Brazil.

The relative usefulness of Severo's São Paulo-centered survey of
traditional architecture in his career as a designer and builder, as
well as the success of Lino's later work, which draws heavily on the
manorial architecture in the Lisbon region [@rosmaninho:2002casa],
exposes the difficulties inherent to the architectural translation of a
literary history based on the diverse authority of popular sources. At
the turn of the century, there is still a long way to go in the
documentation of regional variety in housing types, as proposed by such
early anthropological writers as Adolfo Coelho
[@coelho:1881ethnographia] and hinted at in Casanova's magazine,
even as the traditionalist architects have to
consolidate a visual vocabulary of forms for immediate use.

Beaux-Arts
eclecticism supplies the open-ended grammar of design to tie together
whatever vocabulary is available in the early twentieth century;
Felisberto Ranzini's pragmatic teaching of various picturesque
compositions at the São Paulo Polytechnic is paradigmatic of this
solution [@ficher:2005arquitetos]. This solution is understood to be
temporary by Severo and many in his audience---such as poet Mário de
Andrade, a pioneer of historic preservation and documentation in Brazil.
Nevertheless, the methodological evolution that accompanies the
expansion and specialization of architectural history, fostered by
scholars such as Joaquim de Vasconcellos (1849--1936), ends up being
pitted against this makeshift traditionalist movement, rather than being
leveraged to fill its gaps in documentation. Modernist theoreticians
such as Lucio Costa in Brazil [@costa:1937documentacao1] and Francisco
Keil do Amaral in Portugal [@ollero:2010depois] seize this opportunity
to claim a pretense of methodological superiority [@comas:2010passado]
for their own abstract understanding of tradition over the
traditionalists' iconographic appropriation of the built heritage.

Conclusion
==========

The domain of architectural theory in the nineteenth century is a
notoriously inconstant landscape. In between the dislocation of
neoclassical normative theory and the consolidation of Modernist
hegemony, the disciplinary field is pulled around from many directions:
philosophers, writers, visual artists, engineers, and politicians invest
the concept of architecture with their own worldviews, interests, and
operative methods. Among these several perspectives, I picked the
literary appropriation of architecture as a guiding thread to follow
this landscape through most of the century.

The view from the vantage point of literary history appears quite
different from that taken from the standpoint of professional practice,
or even from a study centered around built objects. Even as architects
become social scientists and grapple with technological development
throughout the nineteenth century, the delimitation of their
disciplinary field moves constantly. In peripheral Western nations, the
succession of artistic movements, the remaking of professional
hierarchies, and the shrinking distance between town and country relate
to one another in unexpected ways.

In the framing of architectural thought, the ascendancy of literary
history and ethnology over professional discourse in is one such
unexpected development of the Portuguese-speaking world. The particular
interests, methods, and frames of knowledge among literary historians
and ethnologists make conventional critical frameworks in the discipline
architecture, such as style or technique, seem less relevant.
Conversely, concepts such as identity and tradition are brought to the
forefront. The simple educational and professional genealogies of
practitioners, a long-established narrative device in art history, must
give way to networks of like minds cutting across disciplinary
boundaries.

The process of replacing a disciplinary expertise handed down across
generations with a constant disquiet about the broader cultural
legitimacy of the discipline is, in fact, something that takes place in
the field of architectural theory at the very same time it is being
conceived as a problem of collective identity. As the nineteenth century
draws to a close, it might well seem that architectural practitioners
regain the upper hand, so to speak, in the theorization of their own
field, appropriating internally the scholarly methods and world-views
that were previously applied on their discipline from the outside. Rather than
this, however, it would perhaps be the case that the whole of the architectural
discipline is being subsumed into the conceptual scheme of literary methods.
