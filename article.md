Introduction
============

The developments in traditionalist architecture in Portugal and Brazil
since the mid nineteenth century once derived much of their motivation
and methodology from literary history and criticism in the Romantic
period. The resulting traditionalist styles have been based on a stark
differentiation between popular and high culture, privileging rural
housing types after the example of ethnographers, who sought the roots
of national literature in the folk poetry in remote communities. The
virtual unity of the Portuguese language prompted architectural
theorists well into the twentieth century to seek likewise a single
stem-type from which to extract either the forms or the spirit of a new
tradition.

Whereas the notion of a unitary architectural stem has been long
discredited, it left behind an imaginary landscape of regional
traditions. A cartography of this landscape would locate not only the
source material leveraged from a variety of vernacular types and
hybrids, but also trace them to the resulting reconstructions, from
explicitly “traditionalist” designs to modernist variations on the
vernacular "spirit."

By envisioning this virtual cartography, I seek to show how architects
and architectural critics in Portugal and Brazil appropriated the goals
and perspectives of literary historians even before the rise of
traditionalist architectural styles. I argue the conflation of diverse
regional traditions into unitary images of national architecture is
evidence not of the "failure" of a retrospectively construed concept of
authenticity, but a way to make sense of a new apparatus of
architectural criticism.

Architectural Theory as Literary Genre
======================================

Crisis of Cultural Nation-building
==================================

The unstable political and cultural climate of the liberal monarchies
wears on through the second half of the nineteenth century. In Portugal
and Brazil, already in the 1860s, literary and artistic elites grow
insecure about the path of nation-building through which the Romantic
generation confidently forged ahead. The forward-looking "history" of
Portuguese-language literature, prevalent in the 1830s and 40s, thus
gives way to a comprehensive search *backwards* for the roots of
Portuguese ethnicity as well as for markers of originality in Brazilian
culture. Architects will play a more cautious and derivative role in
this process, at some times even stepping back altogether from the issue
of national character, at other times expressing a derivative, aesthetic
aspect of debates played out away from their disciplinary field.

Traditionalist Methods and Ethnographic Tools
=============================================

Oftentimes, rather than emulating the basic methods of data collection
performed by ethnographers and literary historians, architectural
theories will build upon the higher-order interpretations and even upon
the general conclusions laid out in that scholarship.
